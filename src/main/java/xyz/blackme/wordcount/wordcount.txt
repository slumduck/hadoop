Hive builds on Hadoop based on static batch processing, which typically has high latency and a lot of overhead when jobs are submitted and scheduled.As a result, Hive does not allow for fast queries with low latency over large data sets. For example, Hive typically has minute latency for queries over hundreds of MB of data sets
Hive is therefore not suitable for applications that require low latency, such as online transaction processing (OLTP).Hive query operation strictly follows the Hadoop MapReduce job execution model. Hive converts users' HiveQL statements into MapReduce jobs through the interpreter and submits them to the Hadoop cluster. Hadoop monitors the job execution process and then returns the job execution results to users.Hive is not designed for online transaction processing, and Hive does not provide real-time queries and row-based data update operations.Hive is best used for batch jobs with large data sets, such as weblog analysis.
